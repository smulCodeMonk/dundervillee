# Writing tests

Next.js has update their docs explaining how to [setup Cypress and/or Jest](https://nextjs.org/docs/testing).

## Jest

With [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) you can run your own tests.

Create all your files in the `test` directory and use the following default filename convention: `[name].test.js`.

You can run your test with `npm run test`.
